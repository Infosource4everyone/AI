			<h4>
			The beginnings of modern AI can be traced to classical philosophers' attempts to describe human thinking as a symbolic system. But the field of AI wasn't formally founded until 1956, at a conference at Dartmouth College, in Hanover, New Hampshire, where the term "artificial intelligence" was coined.

		    <h4>
		    	The history of Artificial Intelligence (AI) began in antiquity, with myths, stories and rumors of artificial beings endowed with intelligence or consciousness by master craftsmen. ... The field of AI research was founded at a workshop held on the campus of Dartmouth College during the summer of 1956.
		    	Designed by Newell and Simon in 1955 it may be considered the first AI program. The person who finally coined the term artificial intelligence and is regarded as the father of AI is John McCarthy.

			<h4>
				Artificial Intelligence is an approach to make a computer, a robot, or a product to think how smart human think and finally this study outputs intelligent software systems. The aim of AI is to improve computer functions which are related to human knowledge, for example, reasoning, learning, and problem-solving.
				<h4>
				Artificial Intelligence is composed of two words Artificial and Intelligence, where Artificial defines "man-made," and intelligence defines "thinking power", hence AI means "a man-made thinking power."<a href="https://www.javatpoint.com/artificial-intelligence-tutorial">[Click here for Brief Introduction]</a>

			Artificial Intelligence (AI) has received tremendous attention from academia, industry, and the general public in recent years. The integration of geography and AI, or GeoAI, provides novel approaches for addressing a variety of problems in the natural environment and our human society. This entry briefly reviews the recent development of AI with a focus on machine learning and deep learning approaches. We discuss the integration of AI with geography and particularly geographic information science, and present a number of GeoAI applications and possible future directions.
